I was pretty sick of the harshly coloured Text Editor that Microsoft provides by default in Visual Studio 2008 and if you're reading this you probably are too.

At first glance the default colouring appears clean and readable, but over time and on a big piece of LCD glass the sheer amount of white light emitting from the IDE makes me want to code behind shutters, put tinting on the LCD, and wear a welders mask to block out the glare.

On my Mac I love the ease of which you can change themes with <a href="http://macromates.com" target="_blank">TextMate</a>, and being inspired by a <a href="http://railscasts.com/about">theme</a> that <a href="http://twitter.com/bjeanes/status/1025826279" target="_blank">@bjeanes</a> directed me to, I found myself wanting to trawl the Internet and find a better theme for VS2008.

I searched and browsed and searched, all the while my searching turning up naught. My poor, watering eyes I didn't know how much longer I could go with the default theme.

Days passed.

Whilst reading up on MVC in ASP.net I noticed a great looking screen-shotted theme Scott Gu was using in his blog, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/16/asp-net-mvc-beta-released.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. The colours were attractive and low contrast it was immediately appealing and I wanted to give it a try. The only problem was there wasn't any information about the theme, so I did a little more searchingÂ and found this <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/04/02/unit-testing-with-silverlight.aspx#6065439" target="_blank">post</a>.

Once loading the theme I fell in love with it immediately but as with all good relationships there was a couple of quirks; specifically with the Selected Text and with the output to the Console window. I played around with the colours and came up with this beauty:
