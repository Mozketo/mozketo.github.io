I'm trying to find the best Bluetooth Mouse for Apple Mac OS X. I really like being able to just turn on a mouse and <em>boom</em> it works without having to plug in a dongle. So I've compiled a mini-review of the Bluetooth mice I've tried to date and hoping you could help me expand the list.<!--more-->
<h2>Bluetooth Mighty Mouse</h2>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/au/mightymouse/">Link</a>. While I want to love the Mighty Mouse I constantly find myself fighting with it.
<h3>Pros</h3>
Works well with OS X as it connects fast and gives a battery level in System Preferences or a pop-up Bezel when the battery runs low. AA batteries.
<h3>Cons</h3>
A little heavy for my liking. Sometimes misreads right-clicks for normal clicks (makes World of Warcraft an exercise in frustration). That scroll nipple is impossible to keep working after 3-6 months, it simply gunks up and stops working reliably.

<h2>Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000</h2>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=099">Link</a>. I'm quite a fan of this little mouse.
<h3>Pros</h3>
Light, fast, easy to pair between OS X and Bootcamp (just remember to turn off/on while the 'puter reboots. Tactile scroll-wheel is still working 12 months later. AAA batteries that last ages.
<h3>Cons</h3>
The movement (perhaps the resolution) of the mouse appears jerky sometimes and any fine moments (eg when using <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a>) renders the mouse impossble. No battery indication in OS X.

Perhaps you have recommendation?
