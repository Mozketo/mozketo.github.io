Here's another VS2008 theme that I tweaked from the theme "Dusk" which is offered by default in Apple's Xcode.

While I've versioned it 1.0 I'd say that this theme is still a work in progress as I've not correctly set the colours for CSS, XML and other items.

And you may of course download it from <a href='http://mozketo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/mozzienight_10.zip'>here</a>. Feel free to play with it, keep it, throw it away, and I'm more than happy to see your creations.

Take a look at the <a href="http://mozketo.com/tag/vs2008/">vs2008</a> tag for more themes.
