Ever been interested to know how many keys you type per day? I certainly was curious to know just how much I type each day (especially while I'm replying to a gazillion email).

##Features

* Automatically count your key presses and mouse clicks each day,
* Boast your typing and clicking prowess with Slack and HipChat integration built-in,
* Easy to use installer,
* Quick and simple check for updates to stay on the latest version,
* Lightweight application that doesn't take a ton of system resources.

## Privacy

* The application doesn't log what you're typing, its only counting the number of keys.
* What you type isn't uploaded to a server or analysed.
* No advertising, there's no interest to store what you're typing.

## Future releases

* Report on keys & clicks over time and not just today,
* Nicer application icon,
* Mouse movement distance calculator.
