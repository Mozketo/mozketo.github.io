Here's a mini review for my new 22" Benq E2200HD LCD monitor I bought from umart.com.au http://tinyurl.com/5jlkqo

I've been looking to get a 22" screen for a while now, but I wanted HDMI (for the xbox) and I really wanted more resolution than the std 1680x1050. Then boom! I see this baby at a fantastic price and at full HD of 1920x1080!!!

So I use DVI for the Macbook Pro and it's beautiful and sharp, and needless to say nice and widescreen (the wider aspect is awesome) Note: it comes with a DVI &amp; RGB cable, so don't buy an extra DVI like I did (doh).

Then on the HDMI connection I have the xbox 360 and it looks great. I played Gears of War 1 for about 20 minutes last night and it looks great. My only complaint is that the blacks aren't very black, but playing with the contrast setting got it a lot better. The speakers aren't wonderful for gaming, but they do me just fine.

The viewing angles appear to be nice and wide, but not super wide. I wish the blacks were blacker, and the whites whiter. But the screen is big, colourful, with a good array of connectors RGB/DVI/HDMI/3.5mm sound jack.

Telling the screen to switch between the DVI &amp; HDMI can at times be slow, but not impossible.

It displays vista/osx/xbox360 just beautifully and at this perfect price I can't recommend it enough.

<em>Update 15 December 2008:</em>

After using the screen some more I'm still really impressed and very happy with the purchase. The screen is ultra bright and have to turn the brightness down of a night time, but makes day-time usage just fantastic.

Also being able to plug a headset into the 3.5" jack (easily found on the left of the screen) is a big win, as xbox 360 playing has to be quiet as my office is surrounded by bedrooms.

I still wish that the blacks were blacker.

When switching between the 15" Macbook Pro and the 22" Benq I find the text on the 22" not as sharp as the 15". I'm guessing the Macbook Pro panel is higher-quality. That being said, the 22" sharpness with text is just fine.


<em>Update 13 Jan 2009:</em>
I just used the OS X colour calibration tool (in expert mode) and the colours now pop. The whites are nice and white, photos look great and the text looks a lot better. Totally recommend you try it from: System Preferences > Displays > Color.
