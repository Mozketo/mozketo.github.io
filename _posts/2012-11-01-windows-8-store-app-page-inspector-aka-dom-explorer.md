I recently had a frustration trying to inspect the DOM while writing a Windows 8 Store App with HTML5 and JavaScript. Finding a way to Inspect Element as if I was using Chrome or Safari wasn't possiblee. 

I knew Microsoft would have solved this issue and I couldn't find anything using Google. That's because I was googling 'Windows 8 Store App page inspector' whereas I should have been Googling 'Windows 8 Store App DOM Explorer'.

Now that I have the correct search term; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh441474.aspx">Quickstart: Debugging apps (JavaScript)</a>

In short:

1. Debug the Metro app in Simulator or Local Machine,
2. Switch back to Visual Studio 2012,
3. Press F12 or click DOM Explorer.
