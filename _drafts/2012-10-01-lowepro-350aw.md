I recently received the best gift ever, a Lowepro Pro Runner 350AW DSLR Backpack (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-Pro-Runner-350-Black/dp/B000CBLYVG" title="amazon.com" target="_blank">amazon.com</a>) and I love this Backpack soooooo much I need to write about it.

The bag is very sturdy and doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart any time soon. The zips are zippy and sewn into the bag well. My only complaint about the zips is sometimes the zip lip (which will help keep drizzle/splashes off the zip) will occasionally fall into the zip and you need to pull the zip back, hold up the lip and zip again.

There is ample padding on the shoulders and back, even part of the waist strap is thickly padded. Lowepro claim that you can tuck the waist strap in, but that would get a little squishy if you've a notebook in the back.

Notebook? Did I mention that this backpack also has a space for your notebook? I've a 15" Macbook Pro 2010, and while it fits snuggly I'm concerned over time the zips will scrape the notebook. I think I need to get a thin cover or sleeve for the MBP.

The backpack itself is relatively light, but by the time it's loaded up it will start to feel very weighty. But it's a backpack and expected.

If you Google for the make/model you'll find plenty of images (especially of the externals) so I thought I'd share the internal layout of my backpack.

The internal flap is also fantastic at holding little bits and pieces.

Overall I love this bag. It's exceptionally large for the price and will hold plenty of gear and I feel that it's future proofing for the day I own a large L-series zoom lens.
